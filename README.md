# DesignPatterns
Design Pattern Using Typescript
* Design patterns are grouped in to three section, depending on the problems they solved
  1. creational: Its about instantiating objects, how objects are instantiated and how many of them created.
  2. structural: Apps structure, sometimes we have complex classes/objects that are composed from smaller classes and objects.
  3. Behavioural: Determine the ways application flow and how objects interact/communicate with each other.
 
* singleton patters? (one of the creational design pattern)
  Use to have a single instance of a specific class in the whole application
  
  Benefits:
  Shared State: Use to store application state most common in mobile application
  Avoid long initializations:
  cross-class communication
  Perfectly represents unique item
  
* Factory Pattern?:
  Combination of single responsibility and open closed principles
    The open/closed principle states "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification", that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code.
